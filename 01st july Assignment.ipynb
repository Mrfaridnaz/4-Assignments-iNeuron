    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to improve the organization and structure of software by modeling it as a collection of interacting objects. Each object is an instance of a class, which encapsulates both data and the methods that operate on that data. This approach aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class, to protect the data and hide implementation details.\n",
    "Inheritance: Allowing new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, allowing for flexible and interchangeable object use.\n",
    "Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by exposing only the necessary parts of an object while hiding its internal workings.\n",

    "Methods: Objects also have methods, which are functions associated with the object. For instance, \n",
    "    a string object might have methods like .lower() to convert the string to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: Every object has a unique identity, which is usually an address in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Each object belongs to a specific type or class, which defines what data the object holds and \n",
    "    what methods are available. For example, int, str, and list are different types of objects in \n",
    "    Python.\n",

    "    others are immutable (their state cannot be changed, like tuples).\n",

    "Objects are created from classes, which are blueprints defining the structure and behavior of the \n",
